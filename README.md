### Project: SQLink - A Murder-Mystery Game

*SQLink* is an interactive murder-mystery game designed to test your SQL and investigative skills. Dive into a fictional crime scenario, explore evidence, and use SQL queries to uncover clues, analyze data, and solve the case. The goal is to combine logical deduction with database queries to identify the murderer.

Players can input SQL queries to investigate phone records, relationships, clues, and alibis. The game encourages learning SQL in an engaging and fun way.

**Tools and Frameworks Used:**
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML
  - CSS 
  - JavaScript 
  - CodeMirror (SQL editor integration for writing queries)
  - Confetti.js (celebratory animation for correct guesses)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js (Express server)
  - SQLite3 (in-memory database for querying)
  - RestAPIs (for handling SQL query execution and game interaction)

### Game Features:
- **Investigate**: Write SQL queries to extract information from various tables (e.g., PhoneRecords, Clues, Persons) and uncover important evidence.
- **Observe**: Analyze the query results to piece together the mystery.
- **Solve**: Enter the name of the suspect based on your findings and test if you're correct. Confetti will rain down if you catch the culprit!
